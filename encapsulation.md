"encapsulation" 


encapsulation simply means of "attributes and functions are always binded together" 

To see how all the three access modifiers work make sure to remeber that attribute and functions " OF A CLASS " are binded together.


You can never have the child's class function more restricted than the parents' class function.

because that way there is case that you are able to access the parents' class functino and not the child class' function 
via the object of the child class which doesn't make sense
or else why would we extend the parent class function.
