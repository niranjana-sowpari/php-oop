"abstraction" 

 - Abstract - means incomplete 
 - Abstract classes - means incomplete classes
   and abstract classes have atleast one abstract function ( incomplete function )

 - Abstract Function -  we declare but we dont implement( definition )

 - We cant create an object of an abstract class

 - Child class of an abstract class must contain the implementation of the abstract function

 - Abstract function can not have a body

 - Abstract functions are mainly used to have some mandatory implementations of some functionality like having to take id proofs in banking
